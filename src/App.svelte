<h1> BUSCAR: Biased Urns for efficient Stopping Criteria in technology-Assisted Reviews </h1>
<p>When we use machine learning to assist in screening documents for a systematic
review, we often identify a majority of the relevant records before we have seen every record.
However, if we want to save work, we need to stop early, and we have no way of knowing for sure how
many relevant records we might have missed.
<p>If we see a large number of irrelevant records in a row, this is a good sign that
the proportion of remaining documents that are relevant is low.
<p>Before we use this intuition as a basis for stopping screening, we can calculate
the implications of this estimated low prevalence for recall,
or the proportion of relevant records we actually identify.
<p>The calculator below does this on the basis of the stopping criteria documented in
<a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-020-01521-4">Callaghan and MÃ¼ller-Hansen (2020)</a>. Please cite this paper if you use this calculator.
